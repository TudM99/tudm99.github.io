In the video below, I'll showcase a simple payload, usable for labs with AV presence.

Defender didn't detect it, so I decided to try it out with a popular free AV solution.

While we can easily navigate and even download some PS scripts. Attempting to use the meterpreter "getsystem" function gets caught.

But this should be enough for a lab / an exam / etc. 

That's it, just wanted to show this off
