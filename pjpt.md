title: My PJPT Experience
description: Turning 48h into 5h by following the workflow
---

Hey there! If you're thinking about taking the PJPT, first of all, congrats! It'll give you a much needed confidence boost!

Now, I came across the PJPT through Linkedin. There, I found out about Heath Adams (kudos to him), Alex Olsen, and the TCM Security community as a whole.

They're relatively fresh on the market, and they place practice above everything. If your pentesting knowledge can only be applied on multiple-choice questions, well.. you may now fair so well in the real life.

Back at it.

I woke up at around 8:30AM, made sure my tools were ready, popped up nessus and a simple http server, and launched the environment.

Now, I won't be able to talk about it, but I'm allowed to talk about my feelings at that time.

Imagine looking at a boulder in the distance while you're walking towards it, and you have 48h to stop it from falling on you. That's how I felt.

I started the exam, everything was going well, SUSPICIOUSLY WELL. I had no confidence, I figured that I entered a rabbit whole with nothing at the end, so I restarted the process using the workflow I constructed from the course.

## First roadblock

Alright, about two hours passed, and a tool wasn't working. I figured it's either my fault, or there's something wrong with the environment.

I contacted the support team, and Dewalt (love u man), contacted me on discord and provided me with instructions to make sure my tooling was on point.

Turns out, the poor man had to struggle with me just for him to realise that I had an extra letter in my command.

In about 30min, I figured that out too, but at least I was at peace that it was my fault and not the environment's.

(Fun fact, that tool dind't help me a bit)

## Second and final roadblock

I was 3 hours in, I remember this specific time because I looked at the clock when I hit this stop, I really needed a ciggy.

Can't get into details, BUT. If you just follow the PEH course that comes with the certification, trust me, you'll pass with no issues.

Thing is, I spent 2 hours just repeating my process until that point, because I honestly felt like I hit a stone wall.

And of course, as all things cert-related, it was my fault. One step. One _small_ step. That's all it took for me to overlook and get stuck.

All in all, it took me about 5 hours to finish the exam. I was really anxious, kept asking myself if I was really finished.

Keep in mind, THIS IS NOT A CTF. You'll have no flags, no matter what the environment will look like. Don't treat this as a CTF or you will get stuck. 

Read the penetration testing reports provided by TCM, see what they look for, what needs to be said, and what's the final objective most of the time.

It'll help you with the exam, and the report writing after the exam.

Speaking of the report, I LOVED WRITING IT! I felt like a part of my dream-job was being fulfilled. Granted, I love doing paperwork, but still.

If you have the time, do labs on THM, or HTB and write reports for them. Don't think writeup, think report. Again, check the provided pentest reports.

The report took me the rest of the day, and the morning of my second day I submitted it.

## Conclusion

Affordable, great course provided, and helpful support team. 

I urge you to take this. And if you have the money, go for the PNPT.
