      <p>Hey there! If you’re thinking about taking the PJPT, first of all, congrats! It’ll give you a much needed confidence boost!</p>

<p>Now, I came across the PJPT through Linkedin. There, I found out about Heath Adams (kudos to him), Alex Olsen, and the TCM Security community as a whole.</p>

<p>They’re relatively fresh on the market, and they place practice above everything. If your pentesting knowledge can only be applied on multiple-choice questions, well.. you may not fare so well in the real life.</p>

<p>Back at it.</p>

<p>I woke up at around 8:30AM, made sure my tools were ready, popped up nessus and a simple http server, and launched the environment.</p>

<p>Now, I won’t be able to talk about it, but I’m allowed to talk about my feelings at that time.</p>

<p>Imagine looking at a boulder in the distance while you’re walking towards it, and you have 48h to stop it from falling on you. That’s how I felt.</p>

<p>I started the exam, everything was going well, SUSPICIOUSLY WELL. I had no confidence, I figured that I entered a rabbit whole with nothing at the end, so I restarted the process using the workflow I constructed from the course.</p>

<h2 id="first-roadblock">First roadblock</h2>

<p>Alright, about two hours passed, and a tool wasn’t working. I figured it’s either my fault, or there’s something wrong with the environment.</p>

<p>I contacted the support team, and Dewalt (love u man), contacted me on discord and provided me with instructions to make sure my tooling was on point.</p>

<p>Turns out, the poor man had to struggle with me just for him to realise that I had an extra letter in my command.</p>

<p>In about 30min, I figured that out too, but at least I was at peace that it was my fault and not the environment’s.</p>

<p>(Fun fact, that tool dind’t help me a bit)</p>

<h2 id="second-and-final-roadblock">Second and final roadblock</h2>

<p>I was 3 hours in, I remember this specific time because I looked at the clock when I hit this stop, I really needed a ciggy.</p>

<p>Can’t get into details, BUT. If you just follow the PEH course that comes with the certification, trust me, you’ll pass with no issues.</p>

<p>Thing is, I spent 2 hours just repeating my process until that point, because I honestly felt like I hit a stone wall.</p>

<p>And of course, as all things cert-related, it was my fault. One step. One <em>small</em> step. That’s all it took for me to overlook and get stuck.</p>

<p>All in all, it took me about 5 hours to finish the exam. I was really anxious, kept asking myself if I was really finished.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, THIS IS NOT A CTF. You’ll have no flags, no matter what the environment will look like. Don’t treat this as a CTF or you will get stuck.</p>

<p>Read the penetration testing reports provided by TCM, see what they look for, what needs to be said, and what’s the final objective most of the time.</p>

<p>It’ll help you with the exam, and the report writing after the exam.</p>

<p>Speaking of the report, I LOVED WRITING IT! I felt like a part of my dream-job was being fulfilled. Granted, I love doing paperwork, but still.</p>

<p>If you have the time, do labs on THM, or HTB and write reports for them. Don’t think writeup, think report. Again, check the provided pentest reports.</p>

<p>The report took me the rest of the day, and the morning of my second day I submitted it.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Affordable, great course provided, and helpful support team.</p>

<p>I urge you to take this. And if you have the money, go for the PNPT.</p>
